        You accept a job as a hotel manager in a small seaside resort, only to realize that it is haunted and your only guests are... spirits! Take care of your ghostly clients: fulfill their requests by opening the restaurant or find what they're asking for by fishing, gardening, and more. Keep the hotel running smoothly with day-to-day tasks, from delivering room service to cleaning and repairing broken items.
